# Twitter Bot for Content Generation
Dynamically pull data from my personal database, available apis and reposiroties to generate twitter content for 31 days.

Each day has unique logic to arrive at a single item/topic to focus in on, create media, and create a tweet based built on top of the arrived upon logic.

Days 1-4
Create logic circling around Cardkingdom Buylist and compare against every other online buylist available

Days 5-8
Create logic circling around Hareryua Buylist and compare against every other online buylist available

Days 9-12
Lets look at singles churn rate, velocity is all that matters

Day 13
Advertising BAN's Podcast. I spend a lot of time editing that now so I can promote this firmly in my mind.

Day 14-17
Focus in on price movements of items churning well

Day 18-21
MTGO Results from the past month. If meta's begin changing, should show here. 

Day 22-25
Focuses solely on sealed product (Secret Lair excluded)

Day 26
Something I'm proud of, reading into the cardkingdom buylist directly. I have a sneaking suspicion whoever creates their 'hot buy list' is not reviewing the data they're putting out, or, more likely maybe, has more information at hand. In any case, this is a review of what their data is indicating is their most desired cards.

Day 27-30
Dedicated to Secret Lairs Sealed and Singles entirely

Day 31
Promotion for MTGBAN.com
